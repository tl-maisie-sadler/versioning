- Test for invalid date format in the header
- Fallback to token
- Alternative to Activity for passing state?

qu: If I put a date, do we want it to go "down" to last date, or is it ok to show the requested date?
- Even if there were no changes?

- Could I put tomorrows date and get unreleased features?
- How would we do beta features?

Roll out plan would be to release code with date in future, test and hope that it's ok on that date?
- Another option would be to have the dates map to a versino
  - Would this mean that code wouldn't just appear on a date, if you didn't want it to?
